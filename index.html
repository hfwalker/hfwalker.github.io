		<p> A former non-profit fundraiser with four years of experience managing a $2.3M annual fund program, cultivating relationships and soliciting gifts from individuals who are as passionate about the environment as I am.</p> 

		<p>This year, I will transition from a career fostering positive relationships between donors and an organization they love to a career facilitating enjoyable experiences for users with the products they love.</p> 

		<p>I am a curious and empathetic strategic-thinker and am at my best when I have a problem to solve. With experience in HTML and CSS, stakeholder management, and with an eye for intuitive design, I will strive to blend the needs of business, design and technology, while bringing a focus to understanding and advocating for the user. </p>
